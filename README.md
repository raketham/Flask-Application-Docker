# What Is Docker?

Docker is a tool which helps to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Docker provides developers and operators with a friendly interface to build, ship, and run containers on any environment. To install docker follow the link https://www.docker.com/get-started

Containers are a group of processes run in isolation, these processes are running in a shared kernel.
